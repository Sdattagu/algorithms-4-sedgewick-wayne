Show that the number of different triples that can be chosen from N items is precisely N (N-1)(N-2)/6.
Hint : Use mathematical induction.

This is a combination without repetition.
This means that a triplet ABC and ACB are considered different triplets, even though they contain the same letters.
order does not matter, but the same item can't appear twice in a given triplet.

What is the order mattered? i.e. what if ABC and ACB are considered different triplets?
This would be a permutation without repetition.

if we want all triplets from N items where order does matter, then it is:
N * (N-1) * (N-2).

Then, if we don't care about order, we want to remove the triplets that are 'duplicate'.

in the permutation, for three items in a triplet, there was 3 != 3 * 2 * 1 = 6 possible triplets for the same three items.
Since those 6 are now considered the 'same' -> it's just 1 triplet instead of 6.

We can divide the number from permutation case by a factor of 6.

i.e. (N * (N-1) * (N-1)) / 6
