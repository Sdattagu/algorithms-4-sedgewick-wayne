**

Suppose that your app will have a huge number of 'find the maximum'
operations, but relatively small number of 'insert' and 'remove the maximum' operations.
Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effecitve:
    - heap
    - unordered array
    - ordered array

**

We want to use a heap or ordered array.
If we use an ordered array, we'd have to insert items in O(N), but we get access to max in O(1).
Heap lets us insert in logarithmic time O(logn), and also gives us access to max in O(1).
