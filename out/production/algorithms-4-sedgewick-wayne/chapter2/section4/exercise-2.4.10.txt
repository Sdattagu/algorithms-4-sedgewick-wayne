**

Suppose that we wish to avoid wasting one position in a heap-ordered array pq[],
putting the largest value in pq[0],
its children in pq[1] and pq[2],
and so forth, proceeding in level order.

Where are the parents and children of pq[k]?

**

assume you have a max-heap with three complete levels, like this:

              G
         E        F
      D     C   A    B

if we represented this as a level-order array then G is @ index0, E @ index1, F @ index2, etc.

in that case, for a given node pq[k] which is NOT root...:
    if the node is a left-child of parent:
        parent(pq[k]) = pq[(k-1)/2].
    if the node is a right-child of parent:
        parent(pq[k]) = pq[(k-2)/2].

        You can use floor() function if you dont want to differentiate between left and right- children.
        parent(pq[k]) = floor(pq[(k-2)/2]).

    the left-child of given node:
        left-child(pq[k]) = pq[2*k+1]
    the right-child of given node:
        right-child(pq[k]) = pq[2*k+2].

        have to have separate cases for these.
