    What is the minimum number of items that must be exchanged during a 'remove-max' operation
    in a heap of size N, with no duplicate keys?
**

When we do a remove-max, we exchange the root of the heap (largest item), with the Nth node of the heap.
The Nth node is either the smallest (i.e., all other N-1 nodes are larger than it.), or
it is the second-smallest
    (i.e., the Nth node's sibling (left or right child of the parent of N), is smaller - but they're both smaller than the parent.)
After this exchange, the Nth item is now at the root of the heap. It has to sink down.
    There will be a comparison to its child nodes on each level.
    The minimum number of possible comparisons is 1, in the event that the tree has two levels.
        therefore minimum exchanges for a heap of size N with no duplicates is 2.

**
    Give a heap of size 15 for which the minimum is achieved.
**

if we had a heap with N=3, then for minimum exchanges:

            100
         99      98

add another layer, expand it to N=7:

            100
        99       98
      1    2   97  96

N=15
              100
        99            98
     6     5       97     96
  4    3  2  1    95 94  93 92

**
    Answer the same questions for two and three successive 'remove-max' operations.
**
    For two successive remove-max: minimum number of exchanges is 5.

                            100
                    99              98
               91      92       90       97
             89  88   85  84   87  86   96 95

    after first remove-max, heap looks like this: there were 2 exchanges.

                           99
                   95              98
               91      92      90      97
             89  88   85  84  87  86  96

    after second remove-max, heap looks like this: there were 3 exchanges.

                           98
                  95              97
              91      92      90      96
            89  88   85  84  87  86

    For three successive remove-max: there needs to be 3 more exchanges on top of the ones done for the two prior 'remove-max' ops, for a total of 8.

        After third remove-max op, heap looks like this: there were 3 exchanges.

                                  97
                          95              96
                      91      92      90      86
                    89  88   85  84  87
