**
In MaxPQ, suppose that a client calls insert() with an item that is larger than
all items in the queue, and then immediately calls delMax().
Assume that there are no duplicate keys. Is the resulting heap identical
to the heap as it was before these operations?

Answer same question for two insert() operations (the first with a key larger
than all keys in the queue, and second for a key larger than that one.), followed
by two del-max() operations.
