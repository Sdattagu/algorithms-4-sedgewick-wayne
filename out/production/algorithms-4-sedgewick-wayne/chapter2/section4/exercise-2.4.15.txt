Design a linear-time algorithm to check whether
an array pq[] is a min-oriented heap.

**

a min-heap is valid if the value in every node is smaller than its children.
an array pq[] is level ordered, we can use following indexing scheme:
parent: k
left-child: 2k
right-child: 2k+1

we can write a recursive method which checks whether the children of a given node are larger,
and then call the same method on its children. This will visit each child once, the only work done
in each call is the comparison of less(parent, child).
Since each node is visited once, and a constant amount of work is done, this is linear time.

See certifyHeap.java for code and test.

There is some space use for the recursive call stack.
