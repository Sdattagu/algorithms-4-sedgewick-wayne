Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations,
but only a few 'remove the max' operations.
Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective:
    - heap
    - unordered array
    - ordered array

**

if we used a heap, then inserts and remove the max would both be logarithmic.
This is alright but since we know there are inserts, maybe we can use this info to choose a better data structure for the problem.

if we used an unordered array, inserts would be constant, but removals would take the time for searching.

if we used an ordered array, inserts would be linear, but removals would be constant. We want an unordered array.
