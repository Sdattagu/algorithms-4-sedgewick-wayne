**

(1) Draw all of the different max-heaps that can be made from the five keys:
A B C D E

(2) then, draw all of the different max-heaps that can be made from the five keys:
A1 A2 A3 B1 B2
    *note: numbers just differentiate copies of the same char. helps me draw the stack trace. it's effectively A A A B B.

                            1
                        2       3
                    4       5

(1) we know E has to be at root.
consider all possible sequences of letters A B C D coming in.
there are 24 possible permutations of those letters as input stream.
which of these 24 yield a valid max-heap?

We know D has to be either 2 | 3, since the other chars are smaller.
if D is on 2:
    C can be either 3, 4, or 5.
        if C is 3:
            A can be either 4 or 5.
                if A is 4:
                    B is 5. -> [E, D, C, A, B].
                if A is 5:
                    B is 4. -> [E, D, C, B, A].
        if C is 4:
            A can be either 3 or 5.
                if A is 3:
                    B is 5. -> [E, D, A, C, B].
                if A is 5:
                    B is 3. -> [E, D, B, C, A].
        if C is 5:
            A can be either 3 or 4.
                if A is 3:
                    B is 4. -> {E, D, A, B, C].
                if A is 4:
                    B is 3. -> [E, D, B, A, C].

if D is on 3:
    C has to be on 2.
        therefore, A and B can be either 4 or 5 respectively. That yields the last two possible heaps, for a total of 8.


(2) We know one of the B1 | B2 has to be root.
        if B1 is root:
            B2 can be 2 | 3.
                If B2 is 2:
                    A1, A2, and A3 fill in 3, 4, and 5. there's only one distinct heap from this.
                        B
                      B   A
                    A   A

                If B2 is 3:
                    A1, A2, and A3 fill in 2, 4, or 5. there's only one distinct heap from this.
                        B
                     A     B
                  A     A
